# Todo

* Once the site has been deployed, restrict the Google Maps API key to just the handypooper domain.
* Optimise for mobile, particularly redoing the dual-column to use a Bootstrap grid.
* Insert correct text.
* ~~Make Farnham Castle header background work with sidebars.~~
* Insert ScrollReveal or other library fanciness.
* Make scroll-over animations a bit more fancy.
* Insert "Back to top" button.
* Remove "Home" button as its not really being used.
* Use tinyjpg and/or tinypng to compress all assets. It's really a wonderful tool.
* Add images to other side of dual pane sections, with nice little triangles like in [this site](http://lsproductions.com/).
* Add copyright information in. Creative commons?
